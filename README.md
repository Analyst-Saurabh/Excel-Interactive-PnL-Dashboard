## Overview

This project involves converting a raw set of financial data into an interactive Profit and Loss (PnL) statement dashboard using Excel Pivot Tables. The dashboard allows users to filter a company's finances by region, month, and convert it into a budget vs. actuals dashboard with Pivot Table slicers.

- **Convert Raw Data to Table**: Press `Ctrl+T` to convert the raw data into a table for easier management and analysis.
- **Insert Pivot Table**: Navigate to `Insert` and choose `Pivot Table` to start analyzing the data.
- **Configure Pivot Table**: Select appropriate fields to display the P&L items, such as accounts, dates, and actual figures.

### 2. Making the P&L Dynamic
- **Add Slicers**: Insert slicers for dates and regions to allow dynamic filtering of the P&L statement.
- **Format Slicers**: Adjust the slicer styles for better visual presentation.

### 3. Designing the Dashboard
- **Remove Gridlines**: Go to `View` and uncheck `Gridlines` to create a cleaner look.
- **Add Header and Title**: Insert a header and title to the dashboard for a professional appearance.
- **Customize Slicers and Pivot Table**: Adjust colors, fonts, and styles to match the dashboard design.

### 4. Creating the Budget vs Actuals
- **Add Budget Data**: Include budget figures in the Pivot Table for comparison.
- **Calculate Differences**: Create calculated fields to show the difference in dollars and percentages between actual and budget figures.
- **Format Data**: Ensure the data is formatted correctly for easy interpretation.
